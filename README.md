# KIRVCF

A collection of scripts to parse VCF files and run analysis. KIRVCFparser compiles the genotype frequencies for each position from selected VCF files. VCFparser is a more general parser for unpacking .vcf files. The remaining scripts run specialized analysis. 

In the future this collection of scripts will be more succinctly wrapped into a Python package, but for now there are command line options for many of the scripts.
